# Snake game that's not optimal

I created a snake game then tried to use A* to solve it. The AI works pretty great except that it does'nt. It works fine for a few moves ~25 then crashes as it cannot find a path using A*(eg. when snake enters a closed loop or similar orientations)
Next implementation would require something more complex like Neural Networks or NEAT(Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies)
To install all libraries use `pip install -r requirements. txt` and then run `game.py` to start the game.
